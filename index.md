## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I’m a second-year undergraduate at Cornell University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I’m passionate about engineering challenges across a range of industries, particularly aerospace and automotive.

At Cornell, I’m a member of the Formula SAE Racing Team, where I collaborate with over 60 engineers to design, build, and race a fully electric vehicle. I currently work on the Suspension subteam and am working toward a larger role in Vehicle Dynamics. My hands-on experience here has been invaluable, combining technical design with iterative testing under real-world constraints.

I come from a strong math and physics background—competing in math modeling competitions throughout high school—and I’ve always been driven by curiosity and a love for building. Whether it was fixing my IKEA couch, constructing a six-foot boat out of cardboard, or modeling ski GPS data in MATLAB, I enjoy solving problems in creative and practical ways.

I also bring a solid foundation in business. In high school, I led fundraising efforts to secure over $10,000 for our robotics team, worked at a bank, and developed a personal interest in financial markets.

Outside of academics and engineering, I love playing soccer and steering 40-foot-long dragon boats. I'm inspired by bold ideas and ambitious goals. As JFK once said: “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”

The future of humanity is exciting, and I’m driven to help shape it through engineering.
