These are my math modeling papers that I worked on throughout high school, competing in 3 different components a total of 7 times: [*High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling* (HiMCM)*](https://www.comap.com/contests/himcm-midmcm) x3, [*International Mathematical Modeling Contest (IMMC)*](https://www.immchallenge.org/) x2, [*Modeling the Future Challenge (MTFC)*](https://www.mtfchallenge.org/). Each competition had varied amount of time (HIMCM: 2 weeks, IMMC: 5 days, MTFC: 3 months) but had aligning goals where we would create mathematical models for real world situations to gain useful insight. For example, our HIMCM2023 finalist paper was on a mathematical model built by Lagrangian Multiplier logic to optimize the number of electric busses a given city (e.g. Boston, Philly, Detroit) should buy. The models took into account real world variables, tested with real data, and wrote algorithms using code.  

Each paper below is linked and includes a brief summary, math/code used, results, and co-authors. The couple notable paper submissions are **HiMCM2023**, **IMMC2024**, and **MTFC2023**. Note, I was a lead on some of these projects.

  **Summary**: Developed the Household Readiness Model for Pets (particularly Cats), a mathematical framework that evaluates a household’s suitability for cat ownership by balancing human and pet well-being.

- **HiMCM2023 – E-Bus Paper**  
  **Paper**: November 1, 2023 to November 14, 2023 — [Download PDF]({{ "/assets/math-modeling-papers/HiMCM2023_E_Bus_Paper.pdf" | relative_url }})  
  **Summary**: Developed a constrained optimization model using the Lagrange Multiplier Method to design cost-effective 10-year transition plans for converting diesel bus fleets to electric across Boston, Detroit, and Philadelphia. The model optimizes the number of electric buses and chargers needed by considering route lengths, local electricity pricing (Time of Use), and installation/operational costs. It also includes a transit stop influence analysis and forecasts ecological benefits such as reduced CO₂ emissions and noise pollution, offering actionable insights for city-level decision-making.  
  **Result**: Finalist. Top 6% of 967 Submissions. [PDF Results](https://www.contest.comap.com/highschool/contests/himcm/2023_HiMCM_Results.pdf)

  **Additional Notes**: My favorite paper. First time using multivariable calculus.

- **MTFC2022 – Melanoma Paper**  
  **Paper**: December 15, 2022 (approx) to March 3, 2023 — [Download PDF]({{ "/assets/math-modeling-papers/MTFC2022_Melanoma_Paper.pdf" | relative_url }})  
  **Summary**: Developed a geospatial risk model for melanoma incidence across the U.S. using ArcGIS, demographic data, and environmental variables such as UV index, urbanization, and elevation. Applied Gompertz and first-order regression techniques to assess risk across age, sex, ethnicity, and location. Integrated MATLAB image processing to quantify UV exposure via shading analysis and generated choropleth maps identifying high-risk regions like the Midwest and Mountain West. Results informed public health recommendations targeting high-risk industries and regions with minimal natural UV protection.

  **Summary**: Developed a simulation-based model in Python and R to evaluate and optimize airline boarding and disembarking methods across three aircraft layouts. Modeled passenger behavior—including carry-on stowage delays and aisle congestion—using randomized identities and time-based simulations. Proposed a custom boarding strategy that outperformed traditional methods like front-to-back and randomized boarding, and recommended a column-based disembarkation process to reduce gate time and improve turnaround efficiency.

  **Summary**: Built a comprehensive R-based simulation to model honey bee population dynamics under environmental and biological stressors—including reproduction, starvation, Varroa mite/DWV infestations, predators, and hurricanes. Integrated mathematical tools such as the Leslie Matrix, flat peak cosine function, and haversine function to quantify each factor's impact over time. Additionally, developed an algorithm to determine optimal hive placement and count for pollinating a 20-acre apple orchard, finding 6 hives as ideal.

- **HiMCM2021 – Electric Batteries Paper**  
  **Paper**: February 20xx to March 20xx — [Download PDF]({{ "/assets/math-modeling-papers/HIMCM2021_Electric_Batteries_Paper.pdf" | relative_url }})  
  **Summary**: Developed a multi-layered battery evaluation model to identify the most effective off-grid power solutions for a 1600 ft² home, comparing LFP, AGM, and lead-acid batteries based on capacity, efficiency, and power ratings. Cataloged typical household appliance energy usage and created a simulation to match battery performance to daily load requirements. Identified the Tesla Powerwall 2 as the optimal solution due to its high capacity, fast charge rate, and deep-cycle capability. Also explored emerging technologies like cement-based batteries, concluding their current energy density is insufficient for residential use.

Mrs. Michele MacDonald (Previously Ms. Widener) has been the most help. She not only helped us prepare for these competitions but was always there to support us throughout the 4 years she knew us and the 3 years of math modeling. She helped myself, Yuhan, Youcef, and Tsubasa found the Newton North Math Modeling Club in our sophomore year, 2022.
