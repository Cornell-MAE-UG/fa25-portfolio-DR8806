I am on Cornell University's Formula SAE Racing team. Our team competes in the annual [Formula SAE EV Competition](https://www.fsaeonline.com/); learn more about our team at the [Cornell Racing website](https://cornellracing.org/). For our 2025-2026 race car, I am designing the *Jig Plate* for the suspension subteam. I will talk about that part here. (Note, as of this being written, design is a draft and not finalized).

**Background:**  
Designed and optimized the ARG26 suspension jig plate — a critical off-car fixture used for the precise fabrication (welding and assembly) of all suspension links, including spares. The jig plate ensures dimensional accuracy, improves welding accessibility, and enhances manufacturing efficiency.

> **Note:** ARG26 refers to our 2025–2026 car. Any reference to "ARG25" indicates last year’s model, while "ARG26" relates to this year’s.

**Contributions:**  
The goal for ARG26 was optimization. While there are many ways to build a functional welding jig, this year’s challenge was to make it as efficient and repeatable as possible — with the aim of creating a design that could be reused in future years.

- Led design of the ARG26 jig plate, including geometry, material selection, and fastener choice  
- Identified and resolved ergonomic and functional issues from the ARG25 design  
- Redesigned the baseplate to improve welding access while reducing overall jig size by **26%**  
- Consolidated components, reducing total part count by **27%**  
- Anticipated improvements in cost, manufacturing time, and ease of use

---

**Skills & Takeaways:**  
- Proficiency with **Autodesk Inventor**: parameterization, part interfacing, and design for manufacturing  
- Gained hands-on **manufacturing and fabrication knowledge**  
- Applied **geometry and math** to solve spatial design problems  
- Strengthened **technical communication** through design reviews and documentation
