## Scaled Dragon Boat Model – Personal Build (Winter 2024)  
**Dimensions:** 1.86 meters (6.1 feet), representing 15% of a standard 12.49-meter dragon boat

During the winter of 2024, a 15% scale replica of a traditional 20-person dragon boat was designed and constructed using only repurposed household materials. The final model measured 1.86 meters in length and was built entirely without purchasing new supplies.

Basic CAD software was used to create detailed top-down schematics and cross-sectional views to guide the build. Hundreds of W-shaped cardboard cross-sections and spacers were hand-cut to form the internal frame. Marshmallow sticks were used for their flexural strength to maintain the boat’s curvature, reinforced with wine corks, gardening string, and rubber bands. The exterior was finished with gold-wrapped cardboard salvaged from snack packaging.

A separate miniature 3D-printed version of the boat was also designed and printed, providing a compact physical reference for scale and proportion.

After completion, both models were brought to Cornell and shared with members of the university’s Dragon Boat Club. The project combined digital design, hands-on fabrication, and creative reuse of materials to recreate a culturally significant form in multiple formats.
